                    <p>I live by the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none, but better than a master of one"
                    by that I mean I have a very broad knowledge base and understand every aspect of a system.
                  I do not lock myself into one aspect of a system, but develop an understanding of the full system to
               succeed at any task.  </p>

                            <p>I graduated from Virginia Tech with a BS in Aerospace engineering and a minor in mathematics in 2016.
                            During my time at Tech I was a member or the Marching Virginians, I worked 30 hours a
                            week, and was on two design teams. I had a lot of amazing experiences at Tech, obviously none of
