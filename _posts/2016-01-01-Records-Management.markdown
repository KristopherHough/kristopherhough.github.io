description: Utilizing Microsoft Access I developed a records management plan and database for BSEE an agency within DOI.  I developed VBA functions to run queries which processed data input, created physical labels for records, and linked physical and electronic records.  I created a physical record filing system and captured metadata for over 800 records which the organization previously had no data on.
